Supported project using data pipelines streaming SeeClickFix (city's code enforcement software) tickets to run an analysis on service-level agreement (SLA) compliance on illegal setouts. We found hotspots of increased time to compliance in the south-side of the city, arming the team with data to alert the Department of Public Works to focus more resources on clearing illegal setouts in the region. Also worked to refactor task scheduling codebase for the data pipeline (accessible only in the City of Syracuse private repos).
