Used data pipelines streaming SeeClickFix (city's code enforcement software) tickets to run an analysis on service-level agreement (SLA) compliance on illegal setouts. Found hotspots of increased time to compliance in the south-side of the city, arming the team with data to alert the Department of Public Works to focus more resources on clearing illegal setouts in this region.
