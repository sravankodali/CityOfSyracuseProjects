Used data from SeeClickFix (city's code enforcement software) to run an analysis on service-level agreement (SLA) compliance on illegal setouts. Found hotspots of increased time to compliance in the south-side of the city, helping us alert the Department of Public Works to focus further resources on adherance within this region.
